# Identifying an important resaerch topic
### As you read, look for notes that say things like:
- “this has been understudied” (invitation)
- “no X exists” or “X is always" (overstatement)

### Opportunities to counter/complicate areas of overstudy (similar to overstatement)
- If our undestanding of something is overly based on a region or case, consider how a different case would challenge this?
- That said, it's not enough to study a different case simply because it hasn't been studied yet.

### Interdisciplinary innovation (Kristin Luker’s “bedraggled daisy”)
- If your field or discipline studies some question with a particular set of questions or focus, look at how other disciplines have explored the same issue
- Look for implicit assumptions in fields (your own and others) and how you can problematize or unpack those assumptions
